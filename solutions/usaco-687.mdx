[Official Analysis](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_notlast_bronze_jan17.html)

The test data is not particularly strong. Make sure that your solution outputs
"Tie" in both of the following test cases.

```
4
Bessie 1
Elsie 1
Daisy 2
Gertie 3
```

```
7
Bessie 1
Elsie 1
Daisy 2
Gertie 2
Annabelle 3
Maggie 4
Henrietta 4
```

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

constexpr int COW_NUM = 7;

int main() {
	ifstream read("notlast.in");
	int N;
	read >> N;

	map<string, int> raw;
	for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		string a;
		int b;
		read >> a >> b;
		raw[a] += b;
	}

	vector<pair<int, string>> cows;
	for (pair<string, int> t : raw) {
		cows.push_back({t.second, t.first});
	}
	sort(cows.begin(), cows.end());

	int ind = 0;
	// only move the pointer if all cows produced some milk, as
	// any unmentioned cows will have produced 0 milk
	if (cows.size() == COW_NUM) {
		while (ind < cows.size() && cows[ind].first == cows[0].first) {
			ind++;
		}
	}

	if (ind < cows.size()
			&& (ind + 1 == cows.size() ||
				cows[ind].first != cows[ind + 1].first)) {
		ofstream("notlast.out") << cows[ind].second << endl;
		return 0;
	}
	ofstream("notlast.out") << "Tie" << endl;
}
```
